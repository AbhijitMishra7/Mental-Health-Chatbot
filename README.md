# Introduction

Mental illness is the most neglected health problem in the developing world. Mental disabilities are pervasive, affecting approximately 8% of the worldâ€™s population. Additionally, mental health is perceived as a luxury good but if left untreated mental illness can lead to other commodity disorders, such as depression, substance abuse, and even early mortality. 
My project Mental HealthCare App is an android application that provides psychoeducation and counseling regarding a wide range of problems including depression, anxiety, trauma, and relationship dissolutions with the help of an interactive chatbot. It also recommends recreational activities for users based on their field of interest. This helps in tackling loneliness and improving impaired social relationships. The application also provides the user with an option to speak to a licensed therapist which directs the user to an online counseling website (https://www.7cups.com/online-therapy/ ). 

The programming languages and frameworks used for the application are python (for the chatbot), kotlin(for android app development), and chaquopy (for integrating and running python code on android).
